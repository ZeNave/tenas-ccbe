# tenas_ccbe
my code for using the NAS method, "TENAS", to discover a better inherently explainable architecture for the task of classifying skin lesions.

This code should be used in conjunction with the code from https://github.com/CristianoPatricio/coherent-cbe-skin. and from https://github.com/VITA-Group/TENAS. You should follow their instructions on how to set up your environment.
